Loading Objects
===============

The following sections refer to techniques for emitting SELECT statements for
ORM objects.

For an introduction to querying with the SQLAlchemy ORM, one of the
following tutorials shoud be consulted:

* :doc:`/tutorial` - for :term:`2.0 style` usage

* :doc:`/orm/tutorial` - for :term:`1.x style` usage.

As SQLAlchemy 1.4 represents a transition from 1.x to 2.0 style, the below
sections are currently mixed as far as which style they are using.
